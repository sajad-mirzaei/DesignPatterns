        // Usually, after returning the end result to the client, a builder
        // instance is expected to be ready to start producing another product.

        // of the `GetProduct` method body. However, this behavior is not
        // mandatory, and you can make your builders wait for an explicit reset
        // call from the client code before disposing of the previous result.
